		<strong>Molly</strong> has been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk,
		lying between the copies of <em>Nature, New Scientist</em>, and all the other scientific
		journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed <i>copy</i> of <q>On The Road</q>.
		<u>It had been</u> Molly's <mark>favourite</mark> book since college, and the longer she
		spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
